[.ConversionEvents]
=== ConversionEvents


[.events/create]
==== events/create

`POST /ad_accounts/{ad_account_id}/events`

Send conversions

===== Description

The Pinterest API offers advertisers a way to send Pinterest their conversion information (including web conversions, in-app conversions, or even offline conversions) based on their <code>ad_account_id</code>. The request body should be a JSON object. - This endpoint requires an <code>access_token</code> be generated through Ads Manager. Review the <a href=\"/docs/conversions/conversions/\">Conversions Guide</a> for more details. - The token's <code>user_account</code> must either be the Owner of the specified ad account, or have one of the necessary roles granted to them via <a href=\"https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/share-and-manage-access-to-your-ad-accounts\">Business Access</a>: Admin, Analyst, Audience, Campaign. (Note that the token can be used across multiple ad accounts under an user ID.) - This endpoint has a rate limit of 5,000 calls per minute per ad account. - If the merchant is submitting this information using both Pinterest conversion tags and the Pinterest API, Pinterest will remove duplicate information before reporting. (Note that events that took place offline cannot be deduplicated.)

Optional for VISITOR &#x60;audience_type&#x60;. With the Pinterest tag, you can use event data to capture event details from your website. This object lists all the available predefined event data fields in the Pinterest tag. You can include these event data fields as part of a VISITOR audience’s &#x60;rule&#x60;; however, you **must** specify an &#x60;event&#x60; for the &#x60;event_data&#x60; fields to be evaluated. Besides what’s listed, you can also create your own set of &#x60;event_data&#x60; fields and define their usages or purposes according to your website needs.

A sequence of weekly observations of the relative search volume for this keyword over the past year.&lt;br /&gt;
These values are normalized to a [0-100] range, and can be used to visualize the history of user interest in this keyword.
By default, normalization is applied independently to the time series of each keyword, but the &#x60;normalize_against_group&#x60; query parameter can be used in cases where you wish to compare relative volume between keywords.&lt;br /&gt;
**Note**: The date of each observation is in ISO-8601 format and represents the *end* of the week.  For example, a value of &#x60;2023-10-31&#x60; would include searches that happened between &#x60;2023-10-25&#x60; and &#x60;2023-10-31&#x60;.
