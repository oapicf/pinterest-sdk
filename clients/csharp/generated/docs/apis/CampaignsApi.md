# **CampaignsCreate**
> CampaignBatchWriteResponseModel CampaignsCreate (string adAccountId, List<CampaignCreateItem> campaignCreateItem)

Create campaigns

Create multiple new campaigns. Every campaign has its own campaign_id and houses one or more ad groups, which contain one or more ads.  For more, see [Set up your campaign](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/set-up-your-campaign/).  **Note:** - The values for `lifetime_spend_cap` and `daily_spend_cap` are microcurrency amounts based on the currency field set in the advertiser's profile (e.g. USD).

A microcurrency unit is 10^(-6) of the standard unit of currency selected in the advertiser's profile.  **Equivalency equations**, using dollars as an example currency:  - $1 = 1,000,000 microdollars - 1 microdollar = $0.000001  **To convert between currency and microcurrency**, using dollars as an example currency:  - To convert dollars to microdollars, multiply dollars by 1,000,000 - To convert microdollars to dollars, divide microdollars by 1,000,000
