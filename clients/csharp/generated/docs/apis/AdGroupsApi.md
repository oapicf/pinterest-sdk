# **AdGroupsBidFloorGet**
> BidFloor AdGroupsBidFloorGet (string adAccountId, BidFloorCreate bidFloorCreate)

Get bid floors

List bid floors for your campaign configuration. Bid floors are given in microcurrency values based on the currency in the bid floor specification.  Microcurrency is used to track very small transactions, based on the currency set in the advertiser's profile.  A microcurrency unit is 10^(-6) of the standard unit of currency selected in the advertiser's profile.  **Equivalency equations**, using dollars as an example currency:  * $1 = 1,000,000 microdollars * 1 microdollar = $0.000001  **To convert between currency and microcurrency**, using dollars as an example currency:  * To convert dollars to microdollars, mutiply dollars by 1,000,000 * To convert microdollars to dollars, divide microdollars by 1,000,000  For more on bid floors see [Set your bid](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/set-your-bid).

# **AdGroupsCreate**
> AdGroupsCreate200Response AdGroupsCreate (string adAccountId, List<AdGroupCreateCreate> adGroupCreateCreate)

Create ad groups

Create multiple new ad groups. All ads in a given ad group will have the same budget, bid, run dates, targeting, and placement (search, browse, other).  For more information, [click here](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/campaign-structure).  **Notes:** - `bid_in_micro_currency` and `budget_in_micro_currency` should be expressed in microcurrency amounts based on the currency field set in the advertiser's profile.  Microcurrency is used to track very small transactions, based on the currency set in the advertiser's profile. A microcurrency unit is 10^(-6) of the standard unit of currency selected in the advertiser's profile.  **Equivalency equations**, using dollars as an example currency: - $1 = 1,000,000 microdollars - 1 microdollar = $0.000001  **To convert between currency and microcurrency**, using dollars as an example currency: - To convert dollars to microdollars, multiply dollars by 1,000,000 - To convert microdollars to dollars, divide microdollars by 1,000,000  - Ad groups belong to ad campaigns. Some types of campaigns (e.g. budget optimization) have limits on the number of ad groups they can hold. If you exceed those limits, you will get an error message. - Certain organizations with [closed beta](/docs/getting-started/using-beta-and-restricted-features/) access can set `start_time` and `end_time` at the ad group level for campaigns with Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) objectives: `TRAFFIC`, `AWARENESS`, `WEB_CONVERSIONS`, and `CATALOG_SALES`. All other organizations can set these scheduling parameters for non-CBO campaigns only. - If the parent ad campaign has start and end times set, ad group start and end times must occur within the parent campaign schedule.
