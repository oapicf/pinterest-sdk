List available filter values

Get the available filter attributes and values associated with a given feed or catalog owned by the \"operation user_account\". - By default, the \"operation user_account\" is the token user_account. - `country`, `language`, and `feed_id` are only used in retail catalogs. - Note: It is not guaranteed that all available filter values will be returned. Instead this endpoint will return values from a sample of up to 1000 items.  Optional: Business Access: Specify an `ad_account_id` (obtained via [List ad accounts](/docs/api/v5/#operation/ad_accounts/list)) to use the owner of that ad_account as the \"operation user_account\". In order to do this, the token user_account must have one of the following [Business Access](https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/share-and-manage-access-to-your-ad-accounts) roles on the ad_account: Owner, Admin, Catalogs Manager.
