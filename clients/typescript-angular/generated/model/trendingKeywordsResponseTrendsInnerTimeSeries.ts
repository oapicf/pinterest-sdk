/**
 * A sequence of weekly observations of the relative search volume for this keyword over the past year.<br /> These values are normalized to a [0-100] range, and can be used to visualize the history of user interest in this keyword. By default, normalization is applied independently to the time series of each keyword, but the `normalize_against_group` query parameter can be used in cases where you wish to compare relative volume between keywords.<br /> **Note**: The date of each observation is in ISO-8601 format and represents the *end* of the week.  For example, a value of `2023-10-31` would include searches that happened between `2023-10-25` and `2023-10-31`.
