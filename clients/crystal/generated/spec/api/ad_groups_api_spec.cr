  # @param end_date Metric report end date (UTC). Format: YYYY-MM-DD. Cannot be more than 90 days past start_date.
  # @param ad_group_ids List of Ad group Ids to use to filter the results.
  # @param columns Columns to retrieve, encoded as a comma-separated string. **NOTE**: Any metrics defined as MICRO_DOLLARS returns a value based on the advertiser profile&#39;s currency field. For USD,($1/1,000,000, or $0.000001 - one one-ten-thousandth of a cent). it&#39;s microdollars. Otherwise, it&#39;s in microunits of the advertiser&#39;s currency.&lt;br/&gt;For example, if the advertiser&#39;s currency is GBP (British pound sterling), all MICRO_DOLLARS fields will be in GBP microunits (1/1,000,000 British pound).&lt;br/&gt;If a column has no value, it may not be returned

Some types of campaigns (e.g. budget optimization) have limits on the number of ad groups they can hold. If you exceed those limits, you will get an error message. - Start and end time cannot be set for ad groups that belong to CBO campaigns. Currently, campaigns with the following objective types: TRAFFIC, AWARENESS, WEB_CONVERSIONS, and CATALOG_SALES will default to CBO.
