Postal codes represent more granular, specific areas. Example: `94103` is a postal code for a specifc area in San Francisco, California, U.S.A.  For each ad group, use only one of these methods, depending on which fits your targeting needs. Do not use both. For example, either specify a broader region code like `US-CA` or a more granular postal code within that regon, such as `94103`.  You can specify multiple region codes or postal codes in an array, depending on which method you choose.  Precede a region code array with the `region_codes` key and a postal code value with the `postal_codes` key. Examples:  ``` \"geo\": {   \"region_codes\": [\"US-CA\"] } ```  ``` \"geo\": {   \"postal_codes\": [\"94103\"] } ```  For each ad group, specify at least one `GEO` or `LOCATION`.  If you do not specifiy a `GEO` code, only `LOCATION` values will be targeted (See `LOCATION` parameter in this targeting spec.).
