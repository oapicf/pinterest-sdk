Create targeting templates

Targeting templates allow advertisers to save a set of targeting details including audience lists, keywords &amp; interest, demographics, and placements to use more than once during the campaign creation process.  Templates can be used to build out basic targeting criteria that you plan to use across campaigns and to reuse performance targeting from prior campaigns for new campaigns.
