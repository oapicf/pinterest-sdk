 * Object containing other custom data.
 *

 * @param value Total value of the event. Accepted as a string in the request; it will be parsed into a double. For example, if there are two items in a checkout event, the value should be the total price. We recommend to use pre-tax, pre-shipping final value. for example: ''72.39''
 * @param contentIds List of products IDs. We recommend using this if you are a merchant for PageVisit, AddToCart and Checkouts. For detail, please check <a href=\"https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/before-you-get-started-with-catalogs\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> (Install the Pinterest tag section). for example: ''["red-pinterest-shirt-logo-1","purple-pinterest-shirt-logo-3"]''
