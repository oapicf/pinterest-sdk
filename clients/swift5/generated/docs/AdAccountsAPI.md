Create async request for an analytics report using a template

This takes a template ID and an optional custom timeframe and constructs an asynchronous report based on the template. It returns a token that you can use to download the report when it is ready.

### Example
```swift
// The following code samples are still beta. For any issue, please report via http://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator/issues/new
import OpenAPIClient

let adAccountId = "adAccountId_example" // String | Unique identifier of an ad account.
let templateId = "templateId_example" // String | Unique identifier of a template.
let startDate = Date() // Date | Metric report start date (UTC). Format: YYYY-MM-DD. Cannot be more than 2.5 years back from today. (optional)
let endDate = Date() // Date | Metric report end date (UTC). Format: YYYY-MM-DD. Cannot be more than 2.5 years past start date. (optional)
let granularity = Granularity() // Granularity | TOTAL - metrics are aggregated over the specified date range.<br> DAY - metrics are broken down daily.<br> HOUR - metrics are broken down hourly.<br>WEEKLY - metrics are broken down weekly.<br>MONTHLY - metrics are broken down monthly (optional)

// Create async request for an analytics report using a template
AdAccountsAPI.analyticsCreateTemplateReport(adAccountId: adAccountId, templateId: templateId, startDate: startDate, endDate: endDate, granularity: granularity) { (response, error) in
    guard error == nil else {
