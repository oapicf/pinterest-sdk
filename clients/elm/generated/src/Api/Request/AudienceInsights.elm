{-| Get the scope and type of available audiences, which along with a date, is an audience that has recently had an interaction (referred to here as a type) on pins. Interacted pins can belong to at least the most common **partner** or **Pinterest** scopes. This means that user interactions made on advertiser or partner pins will have the **partner** scope. You can also have user interactions performed in general on Pinterest with the **Pinterest** scope. In that case, you can then use the returned type and scope values together on requests to other endpoints to retrieve insight metrics for a desired audience.
