type CustomerList* = object
  ## 
  adAccountId*: string ## Associated ad account ID.
  createdTime*: float ## Creation time. Unix timestamp in seconds.
  id*: string ## Customer list ID.
  name*: string ## Customer list name.
  numBatches*: float ## Total number of list updates.  List creation counts as one batch. Each <a href=\"/docs/redoc/#operation/ads_v3_customer_list_add_handler_PUT\">Append</a> or <a href=\"/docs/redoc/#operation/ads_v3_customer_list_remove_handler_PUT\">Remove API</a> call counts as another. List creation via the Ads Manager UI could result in more than one batch since the UI breaks up large lists.
  numRemovedUserRecords*: float ## Number of removed user records. In a <a href=\"/docs/redoc/#operation/ads_v3_customer_list_remove_handler_PUT\">Remove API</a> call, this counter increases even if the user is not found in the list.
  numUploadedUserRecords*: float ## Number of uploaded user records. In an <a href=\"/docs/redoc/#operation/ads_v3_customer_list_add_handler_PUT\">Append API</a> call, this counter increases even if the uploaded user is already in the list.
  status*: Status ## Customer list status. TOO_SMALL - the list has less than 100 Pinterest users.
  `type`*: string ## Always \"customerlist\".
  updatedTime*: float ## Last update time. Unix timestamp in seconds.
  exceptions*: object ## Customer list errors
