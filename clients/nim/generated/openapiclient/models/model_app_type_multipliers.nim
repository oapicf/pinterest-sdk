type AppTypeMultipliers* = object
  ## This represents a mapping from app type targeting criteria to a bid price adjustment.  Multiplier values must be between 0 and 10. A value of 10 represents a 900% increase in bid price (from $1 to $10 for example). A value of 0 will stop distribution for this item on the specified app type in `MAX_BID` ad groups in `CATALOG_SALES` campaigns. All app type multipliers must be set at the same time. If a multiplier is not provided it is assumed to be 1 (no bid adjustment).
  APP_TYPE*: TargetingSpecAppType
