Your original list will be deleted when the matching process is complete. The filtered list – containing only the Pinterest accounts that were included in your starting list – is what will be used to create the audience.   To use your customer list after creating it, convert it into a customer list audience by passing the `CUSTOMER_LIST` audience type at the [create audience endpoint](https://developer.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/audiences-create).",
