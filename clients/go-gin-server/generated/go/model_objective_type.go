// ObjectiveType : Campaign objective type. If set as one of [\"AWARENESS\", \"CONSIDERATION\", \"WEB_CONVERSION\", \"CATALOG_SALES\", \"VIDEO_COMPLETION\"] the campaign is considered as a Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) campaign, meaning budget needs to be set at the campaign level rather than at the ad group level. [\"WEB_SESSIONS\"] is DEPRECATED. For update, only draft campaigns may update objective type.
