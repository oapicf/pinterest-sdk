/**
 * Object containing customer information data. Note, It is required at least one of 1) em, 2) hashed_maids or 3) pair client_ip_address + client_user_agent.
 * @param em Sha256 hashes of lowercase version of user's email addresses. Used for matching. We highly recommend this on checkout events at least. It may improve reporting performance such as ROAS/CPA. The string should be in the UTF-8 format.
 * @param hashedMaids Sha256 hashes of user's \"Google Advertising IDs\" (GAIDs) or \"Apple's Identifier for Advertisers\" (IDFAs). Used for matching. We highly recommend this on checkout events at least. It may improve reporting performance such as ROAS/CPA. The string should be in the UTF-8 format.

 * @param clientUserAgent The user agent string of the user's web browser. We highly recommend this for all events. It may improve reporting performance such as ROAS/CPA.
 * @param ph Sha256 hashes of user's phone numbers, only digits with country code, area code, and number. Remove any symbols, letters, spaces and leading zeros. We highly recommend this on checkout events at least. It may improve reporting performance such as ROAS/CPA. The string should be in the UTF-8 format.
 * @param ge Sha256 hashes of user's gender, in lowercase. Either \"f\" or \"m\" or \"n\" for non-binary gender. The string should be in the UTF-8 format.
 * @param db Sha256 hashes of user's date of birthday, given as year, month, and day. The string should be in the UTF-8 format.
 * @param ln Sha256 hashes of user's last name, in lowercase. We highly recommend this on checkout events at least. It may improve reporting performance such as ROAS/CPA. The string should be in the UTF-8 format.
 * @param fn Sha256 hashes of user's first name, in lowercase. We highly recommend this on checkout events at least. It may improve reporting performance such as ROAS/CPA. The string should be in the UTF-8 format.
