# Budget type. If DAILY, an ad group&#39;s daily spend will not exceed the budget parameter value. If LIFETIME, the end_time parameter is **REQUIRED**, and the ad group spend is spread evenly between the ad group &#x60;start_time&#x60; and &#x60;end_time&#x60; range. A CBO campaign automatically generates ad group budgets from its campaign budget to maximize campaign outcome. For CBO campaigns, only \&quot;CBO_ADGROUP\&quot; is allowed. For WEB_SESSIONS campaigns, only \&quot;LIFETIME\&quot; is allowed. For update, only draft ad groups may update budget type.
