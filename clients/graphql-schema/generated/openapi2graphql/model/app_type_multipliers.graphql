# This represents a mapping from app type targeting criteria to a bid price adjustment.  Multiplier values must be between 0 and 10. A value of 10 represents a 900% increase in bid price (from $1 to $10 for example). A value of 0 will stop distribution for this item on the specified app type in &#x60;MAX_BID&#x60; ad groups in &#x60;CATALOG_SALES&#x60; campaigns. All app type multipliers must be set at the same time. If a multiplier is not provided it is assumed to be 1 (no bid adjustment).
