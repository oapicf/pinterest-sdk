# Campaign objective type. If set as one of [\&quot;AWARENESS\&quot;, \&quot;CONSIDERATION\&quot;, \&quot;WEB_CONVERSION\&quot;, \&quot;CATALOG_SALES\&quot;, \&quot;VIDEO_COMPLETION\&quot;] the campaign is considered as a Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) campaign, meaning budget needs to be set at the campaign level rather than at the ad group level. [\&quot;WEB_SESSIONS\&quot;] is DEPRECATED. For update, only draft campaigns may update objective type.
