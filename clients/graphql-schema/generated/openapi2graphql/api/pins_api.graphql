  # Create Pin
  # Create a Pin on a board or board section owned by the \&quot;operation user_account\&quot;.  Note: If the current \&quot;operation user_account\&quot; (defined by the access token) has access to another user&#39;s Ad Accounts via Pinterest Business Access, you can modify your request to make use of the current operation_user_account&#39;s permissions to those Ad Accounts by including the ad_account_id in the path parameters for the request (e.g. .../?ad_account_id&#x3D;12345&amp;...).  - This function is intended solely for publishing new content created by the user. If you are interested in saving content created by others to your Pinterest boards, sometimes called &#39;curated content&#39;, please use our &lt;a href&#x3D;&#39;/docs/web-features/add-ons-overview/&#39;&gt;Save button&lt;/a&gt; instead.
