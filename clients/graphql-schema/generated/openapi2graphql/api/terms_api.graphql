type query {
  # List related terms
  # Get a list of terms logically related to each input term. &lt;p/&gt; Example: the term &#39;workout&#39; would list related terms like &#39;one song workout&#39;, &#39;yoga workout&#39;, &#39;workout motivation&#39;, etc.
  # @param [String!] terms List of input terms.
  # @return [RelatedTerms]
  TermsRelatedList(terms: [String!]): RelatedTerms

  # List suggested terms

  # @param String! term Input term.
  # @param Int! limit Max suggested terms to return.
  # @return [[String!]]
