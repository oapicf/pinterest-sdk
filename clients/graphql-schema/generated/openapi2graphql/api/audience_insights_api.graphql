  # Get audience insights
  # Get Audience Insights for an ad account. The response will return insights for 3 types of audiences: the ad account&#39;s engaged audience on Pinterest, the ad account&#39;s total audience on Pinterest and Pinterest&#39;s total audience.&lt;p/&gt; &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/audience-insights\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Learn more about Audience Insights&lt;/a&gt;.
  # @param String! adAccountId Unique identifier of an ad account.
  # @param AudienceInsightType audienceInsightType Type of audience insights.
  # @return [AudienceInsightsResponse]
  AudienceInsightsGet(adAccountId: String!, audienceInsightType: AudienceInsightType): AudienceInsightsResponse

  # Get audience insights scope and type
  # Get the scope and type of available audiences, which along with a date, is an audience that has recently had an interaction (referred to here as a type) on pins. Interacted pins can belong to at least the most common **partner** or **Pinterest** scopes. This means that user interactions made on advertiser or partner pins will have the **partner** scope. You can also have user interactions performed in general on Pinterest with the **Pinterest** scope. In that case, you can then use the returned type and scope values together on requests to other endpoints to retrieve insight metrics for a desired audience.
  # @param String! adAccountId Unique identifier of an ad account.
  # @return [AudienceDefinitionResponse]
  AudienceInsightsScopeAndTypeGet(adAccountId: String!): AudienceDefinitionResponse
