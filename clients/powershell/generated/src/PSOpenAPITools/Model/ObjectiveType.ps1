.SYNOPSIS

Enum ObjectiveType.

.DESCRIPTION

Campaign objective type. If set as one of [""AWARENESS"", ""CONSIDERATION"", ""WEB_CONVERSION"", ""CATALOG_SALES"", ""VIDEO_COMPLETION""] the campaign is considered as a Campaign Budget Optimization (CBO) campaign, meaning budget needs to be set at the campaign level rather than at the ad group level. [""WEB_SESSIONS""] is DEPRECATED. For update, only draft campaigns may update objective type.
