  # Create customer lists
  # &lt;p&gt;Create a customer list from your records(hashed or plain-text email addresses, or hashed MAIDs or IDFAs).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A customer list is one of the four types of Pinterest audiences: for more information, see &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/audience-targeting\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Audience targeting&lt;/a&gt; or the &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;/docs/api-features/targeting-overview/\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;Audiences&lt;/a&gt; section of the ads management guide.&lt;p/&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Please review our &lt;u&gt;&lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/audience-targeting#section-13341\&quot; target&#x3D;\&quot;_blank\&quot;&gt;requirements&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/u&gt; for what type of information is allowed when uploading a customer list.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you create a customer list, the system scans the list for existing Pinterest accounts; the list must include at least 100 Pinterest accounts. Your original list will be deleted when the matching process is complete. The filtered list – containing only the Pinterest accounts that were included in your starting list – is what will be used to create the audience.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that once you have created your customer list, you must convert it into an audience (of the “ CUSTOMER_LIST” type) using the &lt;a href&#x3D;\&quot;#operation/create_audience_handler\&quot;&gt;create audience endpoint&lt;/a&gt; before it can be used.&lt;/p&gt;
