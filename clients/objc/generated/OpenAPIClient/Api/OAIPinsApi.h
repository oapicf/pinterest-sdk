Optional: Business Access: Specify an <code>ad_account_id</code> (obtained via <a href=\"/docs/api/v5/#operation/ad_accounts/list\">List ad accounts</a>) to use the owner of that ad_account as the \"operation user_account\".

If Pin was created before <code>2023-03-20</code> lifetime metrics will only be available for Video and Idea Pin formats. Lifetime metrics are available for all Pin formats since then.
