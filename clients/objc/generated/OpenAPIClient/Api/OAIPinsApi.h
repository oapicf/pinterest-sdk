/// Get Pin analytics
/// Get analytics for a Pin owned by the \"operation user_account\" - or on a group board that has been shared with this account. - By default, the \"operation user_account\" is the token user_account.  Optional: Business Access: Specify an <code>ad_account_id</code> (obtained via <a href=\"https://developers.pinterest.com/docs/api/v5/#operation/ad_accounts/list\">List ad accounts</a>) to use the owner of that ad_account as the \"operation user_account\". In order to do this, the token user_account must have one of the following <a href=\"https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/share-and-manage-access-to-your-ad-accounts\">Business Access</a> roles on the ad_account:  - For Pins on public or protected boards: Admin, Analyst. - For Pins on secret boards: Admin.  If Pin was created before <code>2023-03-20</code> lifetime metrics will only be available for Video and Idea Pin formats. Lifetime metrics are available for all Pin formats since then.
