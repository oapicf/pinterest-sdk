Send Measurement Source Of Truth (MSOT) attributed conversion events

**This feature is currently in beta and not available to all apps.** If you are interested in joining the beta, reach out to your Pinterest account manager.

The request body should be a JSON object.  - These events will not be used in Reporting.
